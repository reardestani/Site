Hi, I am glad to be able to publish my first blog post in my blog. his post is an introduction post and gives you some basic information of what plans we have for this blog.

Yes, I have had a blog for myself but I was not so active there and actually I did not have some useful informations to share at that time, but now I have gained some nice experiences and like to share with you.

My blog has started like this: after a lot of search and comparison, finally decided to choose a new CMS to create my websites. I am sure you know what I am talking about, from <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> to a new CMS. I finally chose <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> for some reasons. 

I am not going to explain the reasons here, but I am try to provide some tutorials to inform you. It has been a very good experience and I learned a lot during this journey.

Finally, it is planed to write some tutorials, tips, hacks, and useful information in this blog. So stay tuned.
