### Let's talk about the license 
Licensing is a big issue in every project. We try our best to choose the best possible, easy-to-understand solution.

---

#### Are all Bootstrapee items totally free?
Yes, they are free of charge to use. 

---

#### So, why do you ask for payment details during download procedure?
This project is contributor and donation friendly so we have provided a simple way for whom are interested to make a donation, if you do not want to do that, simply enter 0 in the bottom input (which has "name a fair price" label), the payment details section will disappear and you only need to enter your email address to download the item.

---

#### Is there any difference between donators and non-donators in terms of license?
No, just enjoy it.

---

#### So, why should I pay?
We thanks in advance for all donations. The donations help us to provide more high quality, premium freebies in the project. Donator' benefits:

+ Helping an open source project to continue
+ Auto update notifications.
+ Exclusive donators' freebie.
